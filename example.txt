## General information on visa for our students

1) 42 Wolfsburg is different from the regular system of study at German universities (that is based on teaching, not peer learning). Therefore, 42 Wolfsburg is not an accredited university by the German government, and this means that **you need a different type of visa - not the common “student visa” type** that you can see online. Below here, we explain how to apply for such a visa.

2) Very importantly, we also need to point out that **there is a general need (for university students and also for you) to provide a blocked bank account** (”Sperrkonto”) to receive a visa. This account works such that you are asked to pay money into it after your visa application is successful. Then you are asked to open this account, in order to receive your visa by showing the German state that you are financially safe for a year. The sum required for this account is meant to cover your living costs while in Wolfsburg for one year. And each month after you arrive here, you can take 1/12 of the sum and pay for all your living costs. Currently, the required sum is about 11.000 Euro - and the money that you can take from the account each month is enough for student life in Wolfsburg. 

3) At the same time, there is no way around the blocked account, also not with a scholarship by us. Scholarships can only be applied for after arriving here.
